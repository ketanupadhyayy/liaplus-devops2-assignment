Explanation of Different Pipeline Stages
Build Stage:

Purpose: The build stage is responsible for preparing the application for deployment.

Action: In this case, it installs the necessary dependencies using npm install.

GitHub Action:

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install
Test Stage: 

Purpose: If you have tests for your Node.js app, the test stage would run them here.

Action: A typical command could be npm test (if test scripts are defined).

GitHub Action Example:

- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
Deploy Stage:

Purpose: Deploy the built application to the target environment (Azure VM).

Action: This stage uses SSH to connect to the Azure VM, pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository, and restarts the application using pm2.

GitHub Action:

- name: Deploy to Azure VM using SSH
  run: |
    echo "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > key.pem
    chmod 600 key.pem
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i key.pem ${{ secrets.AZURE_VM_USER }}@${{ secrets.AZURE_VM_IP }} << 'EOF'
      cd ~/node_app
      git pull origin main
      pm2 restart app.js
    EOF
