#  Disaster Recovery Strategy for Cloud-based Enterprise Application (Azure)

## Objective
To ensure business continuity in case of service outages, data loss, or system failures by implementing a strong **Disaster Recovery (DR)** and **High Availability (HA)** strategy.

---

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** | Maximum acceptable time to restore service after a disaster. |
| **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | Maximum acceptable data loss (in terms of time). |

---

##  Goals

- Minimize **downtime** and **data loss**
- Ensure application availability and data integrity
- Meet compliance and audit requirements

---

##  DR & HA Strategy Components

### 1. **Automated Backups**
- Schedule daily/weekly backups using **Azure Backup Vault**
- Store backups in geo-redundant storage (GRS)

### 2. **Snapshot Recovery**
- Use **Azure VM Snapshots** for quick state restoration

### 3. **Geo-Redundancy**
- Deploy the application in **multiple regions** using **Availability Zones**
- Set up Azure Traffic Manager to route to healthy regions

### 4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Use **ARM templates** or **Terraform** to quickly redeploy infrastructure

### 5. **Data Replication**
- For databases, use **Azure SQL Geo-Replication** or **PostgreSQL Hyperscale**

### 6. **Testing and Simulation**
- Run **quarterly DR drills** to validate recovery plans
- Keep detailed **runbooks** and logs

##  RTO & RPO

| Component | RTO | RPO |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Web App   | 30 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Database  | 60 minutes | 10 minutes |
| File Storage | 45 minutes | 30 minutes |

---

##  Summary

- Store backups in multiple regions
- Automate recovery using scripts or templates
- Set up alerts and continuous monitoring
- Perform periodic DR testing
